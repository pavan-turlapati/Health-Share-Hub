# About the website

The purpose of the website is to allow common diseased people to communicate on a public forum and share their experience with people suffering from the same disease. Many people suffering with a disease need someone, who has gone through the disease and its treatment, to communicate and know their experience. That way the patient will have someone to motivate and guide them through the procedure. Usually doctors guide the patients but the way an experienced patient motivates someone and gives strength is different.
The Website will allow the user to sign up and create their profile. The User can search for a particular disease and get the relevant information for that disease.

There will be a forum for each disease and users can go through the posts and look at the comments of the people in the forum. Also the user can post the questions and doubts they have on the forum. They can like and dislike a post as well.
